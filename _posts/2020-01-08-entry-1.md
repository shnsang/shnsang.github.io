I finally had a chance to watch the film Joker and I clearly remember the mixed emotions running through my head while I remained sitting in my seat after the movie ended. In my opinion, a well-produced and thought-provoking film contains scenes where the audience is grappled with a number of questions, and has a plot line that is open to one’s interpretation. From a third-person point of view, I was able to get a better understanding of Arthur Fleck’s character as the storyline carefully unfolds. The context and environment hinted at signs of economic recession - bleak and distressing news headlines permeated every source of media; concrete buildings blended together under the grey gloomy sky.

From the very beginning, I felt a sense of sympathy towards Arthur, who was beaten up by several ruthless high school students while doing his job as a for-hire party clown. At the same time, I wondered why he never fought back for his own rights and simply brushed off the situation when talking to his coworkers that “they are just a bunch of kids”. As the movie progresses, it seems that Arthur’s current state of living could not be portrayed any worse: he carries around a medical card explaining his uncontrollable laughing condition; he attends free therapy sessions to obtain prescription drugs; he lives with his frailing mother in a dingy apartment; he gives off a chilling vibe from his dangerously thin figure; he forces himself to smile and be happy while suffering excruciatingly deep down inside… But one routine he would not miss is to watch his TV show idol Murray Franklin captivate the audience. Gazing into the glowing TV lights, Arthur “imagines” himself as a guest who is invited on stage by host Murray, who responds in a fatherly manner that "he would give for a son like you."

### Without giving away too much of the plot, some other thoughts:
- Hold on to those that are kind to you when not everyone is able to empathize
- Laughter and comedy brings out bursts of light in difficult circumstances
- Have a role model to look up to, and painstaking & patiently learn how he/she is able to successfully master his/her craft
- Dream big; Persevere when building up a skill and record your daily progress
- Try not to let stress get to you; Have self-confidence that shines from within yourself
