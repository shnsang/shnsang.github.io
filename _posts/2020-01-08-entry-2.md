### En Route

Pleasantly, the flight from Singapore to Krabi, Thailand was a mere 1.5 hours and I had barely scratched the surface of my novel when the flight attendant cheerfully welcomed us to the sunny province. Having arranged a bus to pick us up directly from the airport, we didn’t spare a single minute waiting around and took the chance to take in the scenery from the comfort of nicely air-conditioned and cushy seats. What struck me at first was how pristine the surroundings were: rows and rows of unknown trees laid neatly along the streets, occasionally a motorbike or tuk-tuk would pass by and gradually disappear from sight, however the faint humming sound of their motors were a pleasant tone. As we slowly approached downtown Ao Nang, we could see forest-covered mountains in the backdrop, which just amazes me how stunning nature is. Finally, we arrived at our hotel which was conveniently situated right alongside Ao Nang beach - to our delight, the staff brought out purple-colored welcome drinks and moist towelettes that were just the refreshing touch each of us needed amidst the humid weather.

### Dinner @KoDam Kitchen

This local restaurant was tucked away from Ao Nang walking street and is truly considered a hidden gem. Since we were quite a large group of 12 people, we reserved seats in advance and sat conveniently near the open kitchen, which offered bursts of tangy and spice-filled aroma. A nice touch was that each table came with a bottle of mosquito repellant, and they were a life saver since seatings are all outdoors. Something about sipping first on a fresh coconut or their fruit shakes helped whet my appetite for upcoming dishes. We ordered three each of the house favorites: pineapple prawn fried rice, pad thai, butter garlic prawns, mixed grilled seafood platter, red curry, stir fried crab, steamed white snapper, and mango sticky rice. Listing this all down seems like it was an excessive amount of food, but given that the dishes were so freshly prepared, not much was left to waste in the end. My personal favorite was the steamed fish and mango sticky rice - would go back again just for both dishes!

### Emerald Pool/Sa Morakot

The ride to Emerald Pool, a natural mineral pool and hot spring, was around 1.5 hours by bus, so by the time we arrived, a few of us felt rather frazzled. However, as soon as our tour guide started leading the way along a winding trail road, I was energized and enjoyed each part of the hiking trail: it was relatively secluded by luscious greenery and brimming with life - school of tiny fish can be seen roaming the crystal-clear pools while I couldn’t help but wonder what other living creatures may be hidden but thriving. Eventually, the path widened up and we could see an emerald-colored pool glistening under the bright sunlight. Although the pool itself was crowded and a bit underwhelming compared to what I had envisioned in my mind, I found the hike itself very calming and worthwhile.

### Tiger Cave Temple/ Wat Tham Suea

This Buddhist temple was definitely my personal highlight of the entire Krabi trip. Without fathoming how steep the steps are, we naively started our climb up the temple at a relatively brisk pace, and was amused by the family of monkeys that were in no sense afraid of people. I guess one particular monkey was feeling a little too thirsty as he/she successfully stole one of my friend’s bottled water and immediately quenched his/her thirst by biting a large hole at the bottom. As we started to realize the never-ending steps and unbearable humidity, our footsteps slowed down and there was a clear distinction among the fast, regular-paced, and struggling-to-continue individuals in our group. A friendly foreigner who was on his way down saw our panting selves and kindly pointed out that we already passed the one-fourth mark, which was quite comforting to know. To our surprise, a young girl maybe only five or six years old was climbing up while her dad followed very closely behind, carefully guarding each of her steps. Her face had turned a bright pink due to the heat, however, she had such a broad smile on her face that is was simply contagious. I immediately felt reinvigorated and continued the climb… Eventually, we all reached the top after taking a few quick breaks in between to make sure no one was left behind. After glancing at the astonishing view below, I was convinced that the 1,237 struggling steps were absolutely worth it. An additional bonus on our way down was to encourage people who are still making their way up either just be smiling or verbally saying “good luck” or “you can do it”!

### Dinner @Gecko Cabane

I utterly loved the interior design of this restaurant: the place gave off a cozy and casual vibe from the fusion of Thai and European decor. The owner was clearly enthusiastic and offered great service and suggestions. Since a few of us did some foodie research before-hand, they knew exactly what recommended dishes to order: lamb shank massaman, pineapple prawn fried rice, pad thai, curry crab, sea bass, tiger prawns, retro banana flambees.

### Night Market

Given a bit of time crunch, we only had about 30 minutes to spare at the night market before our driver would come pick us up. Overall, this place definitely brought back childhood memories when I used to scroll around night markets in my hometown. However, this is at ten times the scale, with every possible street food, cheap eats, souvenir stores, and live entertainment you could imagine.

### Koh Rok Island

Since we booked an island-hopping tour for the day, we traveled on a boat with around 70 guests in total. Initially, I was thrilled to sit at the front and imagined that I would be watching the waves during the trip. Unfortunately, a combination of the rocking movement and flashing sunlight may have contributed to motion-induced fatigue and I quickly fell asleep. Occasionally, I would wake up and feel slightly embarrassed that my head was bobbing up and down. But then almost instantly, I would fall back into a deep state of sleep. Finally, the captain slowed down the boat and stopped at our first snorkeling site. Feeling a little intimidated but filled with eagerness, I followed one of the diving instructors as he guided me underwater to the swarming fish and beautiful corals. A few divers even performed underwater tricks by diving to the bottom and blowing bubbles towards the surface, which was both amusing to watch and unthinkable to see oneself ever doing something similar.
