Hi there! I am __Shenay Sang__ - a warm welcome to my personal website.

If I could describe myself briefly, it would be *adaptable to challenges*, *curiously motivated*, and *capturing the moment*.

Besides my birthplace in China, I am fortunate to have lived abroad and be exposed to multi-faceted and captivating cultures in Australia, the United States, and currently,📍Singapore. The people encountered and different experiences have amalgamated into valuable opportunities for me to learn and grow.

My earliest recollection of writing stems from a primary school project, during which I wrote a short fiction and the teacher's feedback was "I can't wait to read more in the future." Although it has been quite some time since I have attempted to write creatively, journaling for self-reflection and self-discovery is a habit that I recently picked back up in the last year.

One of my favorite quotes by Iyanla Vanzant is:
> _Everything you have experienced has been purposeful. It has brought you to where you are now. You have a collection of experiences to use as stepping stones to take you where you want to go._

Hence, my goal for this website is to document bits of the journey, including my current experience studying __MSc. Business Analytics__ at [The National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg/). I am an alumna of [The University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) (Finance, Economics) and [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/) (Finance).
